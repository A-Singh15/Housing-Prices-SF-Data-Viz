## Introduction

This project analyzes the housing rental market in San Francisco from 2010 to 2021. The analysis uses data from the San Francisco Open Data website: [https://data.sfgov.org/](https://data.sfgov.org/).


The analysis focuses on the following aspects of the housing rental market:

* Number of housing units per year
* Average sale prices per square foot
* Average sale prices by neighborhood

The analysis also includes an interactive neighborhood map that shows the average gross rent and sale price per square foot by neighborhood.

## Key Findings

# Conclusion # 
The trend in rental income growth has outpaced the trend in sales prices. This is likely due to the fact that the supply of rental units has not kept up with the demand. This trend is not the same for all neighborhoods across San Francisco. Some neighborhoods, such as Pacific Heights and Sea Cliff, have seen a significant increase in both rental income and sales prices. Other neighborhoods, such as Bayview and Excelsior, have seen a more modest increase in rental income and sales prices.

The data suggests that the one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that the company is pursuing could be successful in San Francisco. However, the company should carefully consider the neighborhood in which they invest. Some neighborhoods, such as Pacific Heights and Sea Cliff, may be more lucrative than others.
